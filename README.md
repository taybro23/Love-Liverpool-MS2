# Overview

Love Liverpool is a site designed for people who are visiting Liverpool, and I have focused mainly on Liverpool One due to it being 
one of the most popular areas to visit within Liverpool. I have chosen to feature six of the most popular places of interest on my site 
and have included a small amount of information about each one, as well as providing contact information and links to the official websites. 
Below that is a map showing fifteen places to stay, restaurants and shops within Liverpool One. There is then a contact form to allow 
users to ask any relevant questions they have regarding the site or Liverpool itself. 

# UX (User Experience)
## Target Audience

The target audience for this site is people who are interested in visiting Liverpool for recreational purposes. I have selected some 
must-see places, as well as included a range of hotels, restaurants and shops so that people can see what Liverpool has to offer and 
plan their trip in advance.

### Wireframes

Mobile Wireframes
 - I designed my wireframes with mobile devices in mind, and created these first so I knew what elements I had to work 
 with for larger screens. 

Desktop/Laptop Wireframes
 - The transition from mobile to desktop view was a simple transition. The layout for some of the elements have been 
 changed to accommodate the larger screen sizes for example, the “Places Of Interest” will be side by side on large screens and 
 single view on small screens.
